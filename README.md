# XposeMe
A simple app that changes and resets a textview. Written as a sample app for learning the Xposed Framework.

XposeMe is an EXTREMELY basic (as in written in 5 minutes) app that consists of three GUI elements: A "change text" button, a "reset text" button, and a "changed text" textview. Clicking the "Change It!" button (normally) changes the textview text to "I am changed!". Pressing the "Reset" button resets the textview text. 

By using the Xposer module (see my other repo for it), the "Change It!" button will instead change the textview text to "Xp0sed!".
